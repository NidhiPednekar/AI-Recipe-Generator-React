          <h2>Reduce Food Waste</h2>
          <h4>Plan Meals and Make a Shopping List</h4>
<p>Before grocery shopping, plan your meals for the week and make a list of the exact ingredients needed. This prevents impulse buys and ensures you only purchase what you will use, reducing spoilage.</p>

<h4>Store Food Properly to Extend Freshness</h4>
<p>Learning proper food storage techniques can prevent premature spoilage. For example, keep potatoes in a cool, dark place, store herbs in water like fresh flowers, and refrigerate dairy products at the correct temperature.</p>

<h4>Use the “First In, First Out” Rule</h4>
<p>When unpacking groceries, place older food items at the front of the fridge or pantry and newer ones behind them. This encourages you to use older products before they go bad, preventing waste.</p>

<h4>Repurpose Leftovers Creatively</h4>
<p>Transform leftovers into new dishes instead of discarding them. For example, roast chicken leftovers can be used in soups, salads, or sandwiches, and overripe bananas can be turned into smoothies or banana bread.</p>

<h4>Freeze Excess Food Before It Spoils</h4>
<p>Freezing is a great way to preserve food that might go bad before you can eat it. Bread, fruits, vegetables, and even cooked meals can be frozen and used later without losing their nutritional value.</p>

<h4>Use Scraps for Homemade Broths and Compost</h4>
<p>Vegetable peels, herb stems, and bones can be used to make nutritious homemade broths. Any non-usable food scraps can be composted to create natural fertilizer for plants, reducing overall waste.</p>

<h4>Understand Expiration Dates</h4>
<p>Many people throw away food just because the “best by” date has passed. These dates often indicate quality rather than safety. Trust your senses—if a product looks, smells, and tastes fine, it may still be good to eat.</p>
