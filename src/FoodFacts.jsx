          <h2>Food Facts</h2>
          <h4>Honey Never Spoils</h4>
<p>Archaeologists have discovered pots of honey in ancient Egyptian tombs that are over 3,000 years old and still perfectly edible. Its low moisture content and natural acidity make it nearly impossible for bacteria to grow.</p>

<h4>Dark Chocolate is Good for Your Heart</h4>
<p>High-quality dark chocolate (70% cocoa or more) contains flavonoids that help lower blood pressure and improve circulation. It also contains antioxidants that protect cells from damage and reduce inflammation.</p>

<h4>Bananas are Naturally Radioactive</h4>
<p>Bananas contain potassium-40, a radioactive isotope of potassium. However, the levels are extremely low and completely harmless to humans, making bananas a nutritious and safe snack.</p>

<h4>Carrots Were Originally Purple</h4>
<p>The first cultivated carrots, grown around 900 AD in Persia and Afghanistan, were purple, yellow, or white. The familiar orange variety was developed in the 17th century by Dutch farmers as a tribute to the royal House of Orange.</p>

<h4>Peppers Get Spicier as They Ripen</h4>
<p>Capsaicin, the compound responsible for chili peppers heat, increases as the pepper matures. A green jalape√±o is milder than a fully ripened red one, which contains more capsaicin and has a sweeter yet spicier taste.</p>

<h4>Pineapples Take Over a Year to Grow</h4>
<p>Despite their tropical abundance, a single pineapple takes about 18 to 24 months to fully mature. This long growth cycle explains why fresh pineapples can be expensive compared to other fruits.</p>
